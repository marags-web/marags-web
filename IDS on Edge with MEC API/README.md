# Intrusion Detection System(IDS) on Edge with MEC API 


## Background

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) enables the edge network capabilities for application developers – defined by ETSI 

The potential threats related to MEC are abuse of assets, compromised supply chain, DoS attacks and physical security

IDS is a critical cybersecurity tool in today’s rapidly evolving cyberthreats landscape and it is becoming more advanced with adoption on cutting edge Deep Learning (DL) technologies on finding near real time issues 

This is an important tool to address the threats related to MEC security

Hence it was proposed to create MEC IDS that was submitted and accepted to MEC Hackathon 2022
